<h2 id = tribute-info> Notable events in Fawcett's life:</h2>


<ul> 
<li> Born on 18 August 1867 in Torquay, Devon, England.</li>

<li> Fawcett attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned as a lieutenant of the Royal Artillery in 1886, aged just 19. He served in Hong Kong, Malta and Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka), and later worked for the secret service in North Africa and for the War Office in Ireland. </li>

<li> In 1906, Fawcett travelled to South America for the first time in order to act as an independent cartographer, creating a map of the border area between Brazil and Bolivia at the behest of the Royal Geographic Society. Between 1906 and 1924, he made a total of 7 expeditions into the Amazonian jungle to complete mapping projects, tracing the source of the Rio Verde and Heath River and charting previously unexplored jungle territories.</li> 

<li> Early histories of South America written by Spanish conquistadors and explorers detailed the ‘numerous and very large settlements’ of the native peoples. After discovering shards of delicate, ancient pottery on the jungle floor, Fawcett began to formulate the idea that a mysterious lost city, which he named Z, existed deep in the Mato Grosso region of the Amazonian jungle, which would hold answers about pre-Hispanic civilisation.</li>


<li> Convinced that Z, and potentially a lost civilisation, existed, Fawcett tried to raise funds in Britain after the war for his endeavour. He met with derision from archaeologists and experts.
They believed the Amazon could not sustain the kind of large-scale population Fawcett was talking about, dubbing it a ‘counterfeit paradise’ and dismissing the stories and legends he had heard from locals as tall tales designed to impress European outsiders.</li>




<li> In 1920, Fawcett embarked on a solo expedition, accompanied by just pack animals, to try and find Z. Years of experience traversing the jungle meant he was confident in his own ability.However, after being struck down by a debilitating fever and being forced to shoot his animals, he aborted the mission and returned to civilisation. Despite the failure, he had lost no conviction in his belief that Z existed.</li>

<li> 
The final expedition by Fawcett in his attempt to find the Lost City of Z departed in April 1925. Having found financial backing in London, Fawcett enlisted his oldest son Jack and Jack’s best friend, Raleigh Rimell, as his companions on the expedition.

With years of experience behind him and confident that he had 2 fit, loyal companions with him, Fawcett packed light and seemed optimistic. His last known letter was written on 29 May 1925 at a location called Dead Horse Camp, which stated he was planning to head into unexplored territory. Fawcett and the rest of his party were never seen or heard of again.</li>
